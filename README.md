# myContacts AngularJS App

A simple contacts AngularJS app built starting from Angular Seed and Firebase from a tutorial on Udemy.

After looking into Firebase some more, most of the code in the controller could be removed if this was done with three-way binding with Firebase API, not all of the copying of every single attribute between the controller and Firebase in every function.

Also, I used the "controller as" approach rather than setting everything in scope as done in the tutorial.
